# Decomp Text Formatter

## What this is for?

Use this to format a huge plain text into the format Decomp has. Despite poryscript also has a 'format' command, it doesn't necessarily adjusts to what developers need to use, for example, they edited the font width or etc.

## How does it works?</h2>

Just write down in the Input Text box the whole text you want to convert and then clic on Process.
Keep in mind that:

- If you don't know what Output format to choose, leave the default values, as it's the default for pokeemerald too.
- Escape characters and variables such as {PLAYER} won't be managed at all and they will treated as text.
- Also, special characters as emojis or symbols will be treated as text too, but probably the game will throw an error when compiling.
